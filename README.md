Prerequsite:

1. You need to install Riff BOX driver for Blank Flash to work. Extract Riff BOX drivers in a folder (you will find both 32bit and 64bit versions). Open dseo13b.exe and choose "Sign a System File", follow the program instructions and there you go, the program will ask you to reboot. While you reboot press F8 many times until you get a menu, choose "Disable Driver Signature Enforcement" and Windows will boot automatically after that. To enable, simply restart your system.

Method 1 (QFIL):

1. Install latest QPST tools (I used version 2.7 build 437) and open QFIL (I used version 2.0.0.4).
2. Choose Flat Build and select the COM port to which the phone is connected.
3. Select the programmer (mbn file) for MSM8x10 and then choose the rawprogram0.xml and patch0.xml by clicking 'Load XML'.
4. Click Download and watch your phone come back to life. Please try all combinations of the files I uploaded.

Method 2 (Blank Flash):
